# Meet the Team!

The development of the [Map](https://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portal/home/item.html?id=a71c1841907240e1a4d896c8cf2302a8) and this User Manual has been a team effort from the start. Below is a list of team members within OIMA and tribal partners who have been integral to the development of these resources.

If you would like to join the Team, please email Anna Holder at: [anna.holder\@waterboards.ca.gov](mailto:anna.holder@waterboards.ca.gov).
