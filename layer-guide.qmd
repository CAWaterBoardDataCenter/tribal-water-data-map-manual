# Layer Guide

This guide serves to provide greater detail about each layer included in the Tribal Water Data Map.

[NOTE:]{.underline} When opening the map in Map Viewer, the **default** layers that will be displayed include the Indigenous Territories layer (at 50% transparency) and the California Regional Boards Boundaries. To see more details about these layers, read below or click on the layer in the [Layer Dictionary](https://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portal/home/item.html?id=16e2736dbf924effbbab3c771bf569fd) (see instructions on [Map Guide](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/tribal-water-data-map-manual/map-guide.html) page)

[Native Land Digital](https://native-land.ca/about/why-it-matters) "strives to create and foster conversations about the history of colonialism, Indigenous ways of knowing, and settler-Indigenous relations, through educational resources such as our map and Territory Acknowledgement Guide. We strive to go beyond old ways of talking about Indigenous people and to develop a platform where Indigenous communities can represent themselves and their histories on their own terms. In doing so, Native Land Digital creates spaces where non-Indigenous people can be invited and challenged to learn more about the lands they inhabit, the history of those lands, and how to actively be part of a better future going forward together."
