[BIA's](https://www.bia.gov/bia) mission is to "enhance the quality of life, promote economic opportunities, and to carry out the federal responsibilities entrusted to us to protect and improve the trust assets of American Indians and Alaska Natives. We accomplish this by directly empowering Tribal governments through self-governance agreements."

#### Indian_Lands

"The term "Indian land" means: (A) Any land located within the boundaries of an Indian reservation, pueblo, or rancheria; (B) Any land not located within the boundaries of an Indian reservation, pueblo, or rancheria, the title to which is help: (i) In trust by the United States for the benefit of an Indian tribe or an individual Indian; (ii) By an Indian tribe or an individual Indian, subject to restriction against alienation under laws of the United States Definition: Indian land from 25 USC § 3501(2) \\\| LII / Legal Information Institute", [BIA Tract Viewer - Catalog](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/bia-tract-viewer-ca86a)

[Native Land Digital](https://native-land.ca/about/why-it-matters) "strives to create and foster conversations about the history of colonialism, Indigenous ways of knowing, and settler-Indigenous relations, through educational resources such as our map and Territory Acknowledgement Guide. We strive to go beyond old ways of talking about Indigenous people and to develop a platform where Indigenous communities can represent themselves and their histories on their own terms. In doing so, Native Land Digital creates spaces where non-Indigenous people can be invited and challenged to learn more about the lands they inhabit, the history of those lands, and how to actively be part of a better future going forward together."

## Integrated Report and Beneficial Use Layers

### 2024 Integrated Report

::: callout-note
**What is the Integrated Report?**

Waterbodies assessed in the Integrated Report (IR) include surface waterbodies, such as rivers, lakes, and beaches.

Assessed waterbodies are placed into one of five Integrated Report Condition Categories based on the waterbody's ability to support beneficial use(s).

The 303(d) list consists of the waterbodies in Categories 4a, 4b, and 5. These waterbodies can be referred to as "listed" or "impaired".

-   The 303(d) list is based off of Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act, which requires each state to identify waters that do not meet water quality standards and to prioritize those waters for development of total maximum daily load (TMDL)

-   The Clean Water Act also requires each state to report on the overall condition of its surface waterbodies, which is Section 305(b).

California combines its 303(d) lists and 305(b) reports into a single "California Integrated Report".

For more information see:

### Basin Plan Beneficial Uses

::: callout-note
**What are Beneficial Uses?**

Waters that are used for specific purposes (see codes below or in layer properties on the map). These beneficial use waters are designated in regional water board water quality control plans.

Some examples of beneficial uses include: protection and propagation of fish, recreation, agriculture, etc. Waters are often designated with more than one beneficial use.

To ensure the protection of these waters and their beneficial uses, state and regional water quality control plans establish maximum levels of pollutants. When these maximum levels are exceeded and waters cannot support their designated beneficial uses, that is when they are listed as 303(d) or impaired waters.

## CalEnviroScreen

::: callout-note
## What is CalEnviroScreen?

CalEnviroScreen is a science-based screening tool that is used to evaluate communities on pollution burdens and the vulnerability of people living in the communities in order to help identify areas that are disproportionately burdened by cumulative impacts of multiple pollutants and the related health effects.

Results of CalEnviroScreen can be used to help direct resources to those disproportionately affected communities. Darker colors represent higher CalEnviroScreen Scores.

If you are curious to learn more about CalEnviroScreen beyond the questions below, you can access the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment training videos [here](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/calenviroscreen-training-videos).
:::

::: callout-note
## How is the CalEnviroScreen Score calculated?

The CalEnviroScreen score uses Census Tract information and compares levels of exposure, environmental effects, sensitive populations, and socioeconomic factors across tracts.

OEHHA converts raw data values for each indicator into a percentile to be able to compare results across the state.

After each indicator is assigned a percentage, OEHHA calculates the average of the exposure indicator percentiles and the average of the environmental effect percentiles. These two averages are then combined and divided by 10 to calculate the Pollution Burden score, which ranges from 0-10.

This same process is completed for the Population Characteristics, which combines the averages of the indicators for sensitive populations and socioeconomic factors.

The **overall CalEnviroScreen score** is calculated by multiplying the pollution burden by the population characteristics, and ranges from 0-100. This method allows scores from across all census tracts in the state to be compared. A higher score means that a tract has greater overall population vulnerability and pollution burdens. A CalEnviroScreen score is calculated for 8,000 Census Tracts.

See Training [Module 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqFETEZ9lFM&t=599s) for more information and detailed examples

### Hydrography, Water Boundaries

The California Interagency Watershed Map is the State of California's working definition of watershed boundaries. Previous Calwater versions described California watersheds, beginning with the division of the State's 101 million acres into ten **Hydrologic Regions** (HR). Each HR is progressively subdivided into six smaller, nested levels: the **Hydrologic Unit** (HU, major rivers), **Hydrologic Area** (HA, major tributaries), **Hydrologic Sub-Area** (HSA), Super Planning Watershed (**SPW**), and Planning Watershed (**PW**), with the Planning Watershed as the most detailed level. See [metadata](https://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portal/home/item.html?id=6f85ec66bc004820a00de6f5ac8be24d) for more information.
