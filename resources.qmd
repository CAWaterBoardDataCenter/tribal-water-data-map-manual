## Other Data Visualization Tools

[Tribal Drinking Water](https://cawaterdatadive.shinyapps.io/ca-tribal-data/) - This tool is intended to compile and display information that can inform and help prioritize outreach related to drinking water issues in tribal areas within California. It is a work in progress, and is not intended to be a comprehensive source of tribal-related water data.

[Healthy Places Index (HPI)](https://map.healthyplacesindex.org/?) - The HPI maps data on social conditions that drive health â€” like education, job opportunities, clean air and water, and other indicators that are positively associated with life expectancy at birth. The HPI is a project of the Public Health Alliance of Southern California, with the aim of supporting efforts to prioritize equitable community investments and policy.

[Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/interactive_map.html) - The SVI is designed to identify and quantify communities experiencing social vulnerability and help public health officials and local planners better prepare for and respond to emergency events. It is developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.
