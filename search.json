    "text": "Welcome!\nThis is an online User Manual for the California Water Board’s Tribal Water Data Map (Map), written by the California State Water Resources Control Board’s (State Water Board) Office of Information Management and Analysis (OIMA).\nThe purpose of the Map is to increase awareness of and access to the Water Board’s water data resources that intersect with Tribal matters and needs. The interactive Map includes curated data layers that have been requested by tribal partners and that may be useful for California Native American Tribes (tribes) doing environmental or water related work.\nThe purpose of this User Manual is to provide guidance and context so it’s easier for all audiences to use the Map. Content in this User Manual includes curated information that the has been requested by tribal partners and/or that the development Team thinks may be helpful to reference when using the map.\nTo view the status of ongoing Map and User Manual development, visit the Project Management Board.\nThis Quarto book is an open, living, and continuously iterating resource. If you have suggestions for additions or revisions you think should be incorporated into this book, please follow the guidance provided in the Contributing chapter.",

Darker colors represent higher CalEnviroScreen Scores.\nIf you are curious to learn more about CalEnviroScreen beyond the questions below, you can access the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment training videos here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is the CalEnviroScreen Score calculated?\n\n\n\nThe CalEnviroScreen score uses Census Tract information and compares levels of exposure, environmental effects, sensitive populations, and socioeconomic factors across tracts.\nOEHHA converts raw data values for each indicator into a percentile to be able to compare results across the state.\nAfter each indicator is assigned a percentage, OEHHA calculates the average of the exposure indicator percentiles and the average of the environmental effect percentiles. These two averages are then combined and divided by 10 to calculate the Pollution Burden score, which ranges from 0-10.\nThis same process is completed for the Population Characteristics, which combines the averages of the indicators for sensitive populations and socioeconomic factors.\nThe overall CalEnviroScreen score is calculated by multiplying the pollution burden by the population characteristics, and ranges from 0-100. This method allows scores from across all census tracts in the state to be compared. A higher score means that a tract has greater overall population vulnerability and pollution burdens. A CalEnviroScreen score is calculated for 8,000 Census Tracts.\nSee Training Module 6 for more information and detailed examples\n\n\n\n3.3.1 CalEnviroScreen 4.0\nThis layer shows the CalEnviroScreen (CES) 4.0 based on the CES Score percentile.\nCalEnviroScreen is a screening methodology that can be used to help identify California communities that are disproportionately burdened by multiple sources of pollution. CI score ranges from 10 to 100.
