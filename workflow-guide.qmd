# Workflow Guide

This guide compiles information about the workflow for adding/editing/sharing layers to the map.

## Setup

### Useful Contacts

-   *For GIS-related support:* GIS Team ([GIS\@Waterboards.ca.gov](mailto:GIS@Waterboards.ca.gov))
-   *For Information Security support*: Information Security Officer ([ISO\@Waterboards.ca.gov](mailto:ISO@Waterboards.ca.gov))

### Setting up Virtual Desktop

1.  Contact WB Help ([help\@Waterboards.ca.gov](mailto:help@waterboards.ca.gov)) with a request for virtual desktop access.

2.  You will receive your login (something\@epa). The password will **be the same as your WB email password**.

3.  The most relevant shortcuts on desktop are:

    -   **SWRCB GIS Portal:** Central hub to edit map and save files, research for potential data layers hosted by other agencies within the organization

    -   **GIS VDI FAQ Doc:** Explains best practices for virtual desktop and ArcGIS usage

### ArcGIS Pro vs ArcMap Viewer/ArcGIS Online

You can think of ArcGIS Pro as the back end application where you make substantive changes or edits to a map, i.e adding new layers, and ArcGIS Online is where you nicely view those substantive changes. ArcGIS Pro is an actual desktop software application, whereas ArcGIS Online is a cloud-based platform.

ArcGIS Pro is better suited for data manipulation, geoprocessing, and analysis while ArcGIS Online works better for web mapping, sharing, and collaboration.

### Accessing ArcGIS Pro

1.  Open the ArcGIS Pro application. If you are not working from within the CalEPA building, you must be connected to your VPN in order for ArcPro to open.

2.  Login with the same credentials you use to log-in to your computer (username: FirstLetterFirstNameLastname\@EPA, password: same as login)

    -   Example: AHolder\@EPA

    -   There used to be a shared OIMA account with separate credentials, but the Water Boards has since switched away from shared accounts and everything is now in "Groups" but on your own personal account (see Accessing ArcGIS Online section below).

    -   You may have to switch your active portal to [gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portal/](http://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portal/), which you can do by clicking the "Sign in" option in the upper right.

### Accessing ArcGIS Online

1.  Log in to your personal EPA account at [California Water Resources Control Board Portal](https://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portal/home/index.html)
2.  Navigate to your Content and Groups tabs on the top of the page in the toolbar to the left of your log-in/profile.
3.  Make sure you are added to the OIMA Tribal Water Data Map group

## Layer Workflow

From experience, it seems easiest to use ArcGIS Pro to add/edit/manipulate data and layers, and MapViewer (via the ArcGIS Online Portal) to consolidate and edit the Map itself.

### Researching Data Layers

1.  Identify data layers specifically requested by Tribal partners, or data that you feel would be a benefit to have access to. Helpful sources include:

    -   [California Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/)

    -   [California State Geoportal](https://gis.data.ca.gov/)

    -   ArcGIS Online

    -   Living Atlas (in ArcGIS Pro)

    -   Organization search within the SWRCB GIS Portal

2.  Assess the quality of the data. Some things to consider include publication source and date, completeness, and scope. Benefits to using the resources above for adding data layers include:

    1.  The metadata for the data layer is already included, and it can be added as simple as adding the URL of the data source in ArcPro (Map –\> Layer –\> "Add Data" –\> "From Path")

    2.  When those data layers are updated by the host, they will be automatically be updated in the Tribal Water Data Map as well.

3.  If you find data layers outside of internal or public sources such as the sources above, you will need to download the data and "Host" it as a hosted data layer on the State Water Resources Control Board GIS portal (see below for more information).

### Adding a Layer to Map (via ArcGIS Pro)

If you found a data download hosted beyond internal agencies:

1.  Locate the relevant data download (ideally in GeoJSON, Shapefile, or CSV format), or URL to the data source.

    -   You may need to use Geoprocessing tools in ArcGIS Pro to convert GeoJSON files into shapefile so that ArcGIS Pro can read the spatial data and pull the layer into the map.

2.  Download and save the file to OIMA's Tribal Water Data Map [SharePoint folder](https://cawaterboards.sharepoint.com/sites/OIMA/SitePages/Home.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fsites%2FOIMA%2FDocuments%2FTribal%20Projects%2FTribal%20Water%20Data%20Map&FolderCTID=0x01200051F666D80ED9754499D62B7070CDE239&View=%7B3E32EC24%2D9389%2D4EFC%2D8E8C%2D2B955608EA8A%7D).

3.  Make sure you are logged in to your account and open the Tribal Water Data Map project file.

4.  Navigate to the Catalog Pane on the right side of your screen.

5.  If saved to the [SharePoint folder](https://cawaterboards.sharepoint.com/sites/OIMA/SitePages/Home.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fsites%2FOIMA%2FDocuments%2FTribal%20Projects%2FTribal%20Water%20Data%20Map&FolderCTID=0x01200051F666D80ED9754499D62B7070CDE239&View=%7B3E32EC24%2D9389%2D4EFC%2D8E8C%2D2B955608EA8A%7D), navigate to the "Computer" tab right below Catalog and search for the correct folder/path for the downloaded file. From there you can right click on the data layer, and choose "Add to Current Map"

6.  If saved as a hosted layer, you can navigate to the "Portal" tab and search for your saved layer either in the OIMA 'Group' or the wider 'Organization'

    ::: callout-note
    **What is a Hosted Feature Layer?**

    It is feature data that is stored and managed by the hosting server. So if you downloaded data from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, for example, you'd want to then import the data files onto the map, and then convert them to hosted data layers. This essentially creates a copy of the data and hosts it on the Water Boards online portal, but still allows you the functionality to edit the layer as you like.
    :::

#### Editing a Layer

1.  Open a downloaded data file with ArcGIS Pro. 

2.  Key features include:

    -   *Catalog pane (right):* If not visible, go to View → Windows. Here, you can link a folder to create and save new shapefiles, layers, etc. This should be the SharePoint folder from above.
    -   *Portal tab:* Access items from the SWRCB GIS Portal, including the Map itself!
    -   Transformation warnings are OK, just ignore. 

After editing a layer, find it in the list of layers on the left and right click it. Select **Share as Web Layer** if possible, and it will save to the portal.

#### Clipping a Layer

While you would typically want to find data downloads whose scope is only California as this data is more robust, this isn't always possible. There is a simple way to clip California from a layer.

1.  Open the data layer in ArcGIS Pro. 

2.  Make sure you're logged with your credentials. Then, under "Catalog", on the right hand side, click the subheading "Portal," then click "My Groups", make sure to change the toggle button to Groups rather than Content, and then find "California_State_Boundary_shp" in the "OIMA Tribal Water Data Map" folder (This is a shapefile of California's border). Add it as a layer to the current map. 

3.  On the top row of the ribbon toolbar, find the Analysis tab. From there, go to "Tools." Search for "Clip."

4.  Use the data layer as the input field, and the California boundary shapefile as the clip feature. Click "Run" at the bottom.

5.  This new clipping should appear as a layer. Save it as a web layer if possible.

### Adding a Layer to Map (via MapViewer)

1.  In the top navigation bar, click "Content."

2.  In the top left, click the "+ New item" button. 

3.  Add or drag & drop the data file you want to add --- or, paste in the URL. 

4.  When prompted, host it as a feature layer (both file and feature layer, not just file).

5.  Navigate back to the Tribal Water Data Map, and on the right, click "Open in Map Viewer"

6.  At the bottom of the list of layers on the left, there will be a button to **Add a layer**. 

7.  You can add layers from a variety of sources, including **My Content** (if you created a layer as above), **My Organizations** (you found an internal layer to add), and **My Favorites**. 

8.  Organize the new layer.

    -   Organize/reorder it appropriately by clicking and dragging it.
    -   Rename it with the correct number and an appropriate title by pressing the three dots → rename. 
    -   If applicable, adjust its properties (how it'll show up visually on the map) by pressing the three dots → properties. 

9.  **Make sure to save!** If you created a new layer, you will likely be prompted to update sharing permissions, which you should go ahead and do. 

10. Use the eye button to make only the new layer visible, and **screenshot the map** for future use. This photo will be used to make a thumbnail and user guide entry.

## Additional Web Map editing

### Add/Edit the Layer Metadata

1.  Navigate to the layer that you created in ArcGIS Online. This can be through My Content, or by clicking on the layer from the Tribal Water Data Map. 

2.  Edit the layer page, filling in the fields with an appropriate title, description, header, etc. **Make sure to cite data if it is taken from an external source** --- these sources will often have specific instructions on how to cite, or additional agencies they want cited. 

### Creating a Thumbnail

1.  Access the [thumbnails guide](https://cawaterboards.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/dit/BusinessOps/GIS/EdVXD63cIclHo7xjjjw7Hc0BZQ688ahZLylM8JvM82gdYA?e=geQkI8), which houses the templates to create standardized thumbnails for Waterboards GIS content.
2.  Find the appropriate **overlay** --- i.e. "Image Layer," "Point Feature Layer," etc.
3.  Add your screenshot to the slide and resize it such that it fits within the exposed area of the overlay. Right-click the map screenshot and "Send to back" to see the overlay over the image.
4.  Once the thumbnail looks good, **screenshot it** and save it.
5.  Go to the layer page on the portal. In the top left above the thumbnail, press "Edit thumbnail" and upload your created thumbnail.

### Sharing Layers Publicly

Waterboards GIS content must be approved by the GIS team before being publicly shared. Since the Tribal Water Data Map is public, any content or layers that you add must also be publicly shared --- otherwise, the **entire map will not be visible publicly.**

1.  Navigate to the [GIS Wiki](https://wiki.waterboards.ca.gov/gis/doku.php?id#gis_portalswater_board_portal_and_state_geoportal) to review general best practices. You need to submit a [Public Publishing Request form](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/5674de4a29804c738e6da1e41d7c948c?portalUrl=https://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portal) if any substantive changes are made to the map. Fill out the all the fields and submit.
    -   *Data Steward:* Your supervisor
    -   *Program:* OIMA
    -   *Username / Folder:* your log-in username / Whatever folder you put the content in in the portal
2.  **This step only applicable if your content includes data that is not already public:** This is unlikely, unless you've sourced data yourself. The Information Security Officer (ISO) requires that you submit a Data Categorization Package (Data Cat). [Check the Data Cat instructions document here](https://cawaterboards.sharepoint.com/sites/RiskManagement/DataCategorizationLibrary/Forms/AllItems.aspx).
3.  It is important to note that if you have made substantive changes to the map and therefore need to overwrite the existing map and re-publish through ArcPro, you will first need to fill out the Publishing Request Form, but also as of July, 2025 the map ONLY publishes successfully if layers are not grouped. This means that you will need to manually group the layers into their respective "chapters" and "subchapters"/subheadings according to the Layer Guide in Map Viewer.

::: callout-note
Also as of July, 2025 the layer "3.7.1_Groundwater-Basins_DWR" will not load on the map if it is in ArcPro when the map is published. Therefore, if you have overwitten the map and re-published it from ArcPro then once the map is published, before it is made public, you need to manually add the groundwater basins layer into ArcMap Viewer. You can add it using this specific URL: https://utility.arcgis.com/usrsvcs/servers/49807a1fbc584631bdf88d9ca71dd083/rest/services/Geoscientific/i08_B118_CA_GroundwaterBasins/MapServer/0
:::

### Updating Layers:

If the data layers are added directly from one of the public sources above, then the data should update automatically whenever it is updated by the host. However, if the data layer is downloaded from another source and added manually to ArcPro (as with the Bureau of Indian Affairs layers), you will need update these layers manually.

To do this:

1.  Log in to your portal using your EPA log-in
2.  Go to Groups –\> OIMA Tribal Water Data Map
3.  Select one of the hosted layers that requires updating and click on "View Details"
4.  On the right side of the screen you should see a list of options (Open in Map Viewer, Open in Scene Viewer, Publish, Export Data, etc)
    -   Click on Update Data
5.  Click on "Overwrite entire feature layer"
    -   Make sure that when you are doing this, you have downloaded and saved the updated shapefile and zip file under the **exact same name** as the previous shapefile and zip file!

## Edit the User Manual

1.  Copy the GitHub repo with RStudio. (Anna can help you with this initial setup!)

2.  Before each work session, make sure to **pull any changes**. This ensures that the copied repository you have on your local device is up-to-date with changes that someone else may have made. 

3.  Locate and open the Layer Guide .qmd file. 

4.  Edit the user manual to reflect any changes that you've made to the map. To add a new layer, include:

    -   Layer name
    -   Succinct description
    -   Screenshot
    -   More information (only if necessary)
    -   Source
    -   Update frequency

5.  Save your local changes.

6.  Stage your local changes by checking them in the top right interface. 

7.  Commit them by pressing "Commit" and adding a commit message (brief description of changes).

8.  Push these changes to the main repo by pressing "Push."
