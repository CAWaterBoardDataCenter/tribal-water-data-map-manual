# Workflow Guide

This guide compiles some (hopefully) helpful information about the workflow for adding layers to the map.

## Setup

### Useful Contacts

-   *For GIS-related support:* GIS Team ([GIS\@Waterboards.ca.gov](mailto:GIS@Waterboards.ca.gov))
-   *For Information Security support*: Information Security Officer ([ISO\@Waterboards.ca.gov](mailto:ISO@Waterboards.ca.gov))

### Setting up Virtual Desktop

1.  Contact WB Help ([help\@Waterboards.ca.gov](mailto:help@waterboards.ca.gov)) with a request for virtual desktop access.

2.  You will receive your login (something\@epa). The password will **be the same as your WB email password**.

3.  The most relevant shortcuts on desktop are:

    -   **SWRCB GIS Portal:** Central hub to edit map and save files, research for potential data layers hosted by other agencies within the organization

    -   **GIS VDI FAQ Doc:** Explains best practices for virtual desktop and ArcGIS usage

### Accessing ArcGIS Pro

1.  Open the ArcGIS Pro application. 

2.  Login with the OIMA_Mapper credentials.

    -   You may have to switch your active portal to [gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portal/](http://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portal/), which you can do by clicking the "Sign in" option in the upper right.

## Layer Workflow

From my experience, it was easiest to use ArcGIS to edit/manipulate data and layers, and MapViewer (via the GIS Portal) to consolidate and edit the Map itself.

### Researching Data Layers

1.  Identify data layers specifically requested by Tribal partners, or data that you feel would be a benefit to have access to. Helpful sources include:

    -   [California Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/)
    -   [California State Geoportal](https://gis.data.ca.gov/)
    -   ArcGIS Online
    -   Organization search within the SWRCB GIS Portal

2.  Assess the quality of the data. Some things to consider include publication source and date, completeness, and scope.

### Creating a Data Layer

If you found a data download hosted beyond internal agencies:

1.  Locate the relevant data download (ideally in GeoJSON, Shapefile, or CSV format), or URL to the data source.

2.  Login (upper right hand corner) to the ArcGIS Creator Portal with the **OIMA_Mapper** account (obtain the password from Anna Holder).

3.  In the top navigation bar, click "Content."

4.  In the top left, click the "+ New item" button. 

5.  Add or drag & drop the data file you want to add --- or, paste in the URL. 

6.  When prompted, host it as a feature layer (both file and feature layer, not just file).

### Adding a Layer to Map (via MapViewer)

1.  Click on the Tribal Water Data Initiatives Map to open it.

2.  On the right, click "Open in Map Viewer Classic." 

3.  At the bottom of the list of layers on the left, there will be a button to **Add a layer**. 

4.  You can add layers from a variety of sources, including **My Content** (if you created a layer as above), **My Organizations** (you found an internal layer to add), and **My Favorites**. 

5.  Organize the new layer.

    -   Organize/reorder it appropriately by clicking and dragging it.
    -   Rename it with the correct number and an appropriate title by pressing the three dots → rename. 
    -   If applicable, adjust its properties (how it'll show up visually on the map) by pressing the three dots → properties. 

6.  **Make sure to save!** If you created a new layer, you will likely be prompted to update sharing permissions, which you should go ahead and do. 

7.  Use the eye button to make only the new layer visible, and **screenshot the map** for future use. This photo will be used to make a thumbnail and user guide entry.

## Working with ArcGIS Pro

### Editing a Layer

1.  Open a downloaded data file with ArcGIS Pro. 

2.  Key features include:

    -   *Catalog pane (right):* If not visible, go to View → Windows. Here, you can link a folder to create and save new shapefiles, layers, etc.
    -   *Portal tab:* Access items from the SWRCB GIS Portal, including the Map itself!
    -   Transformation warnings are OK, just ignore. 

After editing a layer, find it in the list of layers on the left and right click it. Select **Share as Web Layer** if possible, and it will save to the portal.

### Clipping a Layer

While you would typically want to find data downloads whose scope is only California as this data is more robust, this isn't always possible! There is a simple way to clip California from a layer.

1.  Open the data layer in ArcGIS Pro. 

2.  Make sure you're logged into OIMA_Mapper. Then, from "Portal," find "California_State_Boundary_shp." (This is a shapefile of California's border) and add it as a layer to the current map. 

3.  In the Analysis tab at the top, go to "Tools." Search for "Clip."

4.  Use the data layer as the input field, and the California boundary shapefile as the clip feature.

5.  This new clipping should appear as a layer. Save it as a web layer if possible.

## Wrapping Up

### Edit the Layer Page

1.  Navigate to the layer that you created. This can be through My Content, or by clicking on the layer from the Tribal Water Data Initiatives Map (scroll down). 

2.  Edit the layer page, filling in the fields with an appropriate title, description, header, etc. **Make sure to cite data if it is taken from an external source** --- these sources will often have specific instructions on how to cite, or additional agencies they want cited. 

### Creating a Thumbnail

1.  Access the [thumbnails guide](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1wS0ZZgf3x0yTxnt5Y-Lz9dB1XKxui7-L), which houses the templates to create standardized thumbnails for Waterboards GIS content.
2.  Find the appropriate **overlay** --- i.e. "Image Layer," "Point Feature Layer," etc.
3.  Add your screenshot to the slide and resize it such that it fits within the exposed area of the overlay. Right-click the map screenshot and "Send to back" to see the overlay over the image.
4.  Once the thumbnail looks good, **screenshot it** and save it.
5.  Go to the layer page on the portal. In the top left above the thumbnail, press "Edit thumbnail" and upload your created thumbnail.

### Sharing Layers Publicly

Waterboards GIS content must be approved by the GIS team before being publicly shared. Since the Tribal Water Data Initiatives map is public, any content or layers that you add must also be publicly shared --- otherwise, the **entire map will not be visible publicly.**

1.  Navigate to the [GIS Wiki](https://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portal/apps/experiencebuilder/experience/?id=f95bb914c05c4abe91013b78894182e1&page=GIS-Data#layout_1016_block_13) and scroll down on this page to access the Public Publishing Request form. Fill out the fields and submit.
    -   *Data Steward:* Your supervisor
    -   *Program:* OIMA
    -   *Username / Folder:* OIMA_Mapper / Whatever folder you put the content in in the portal
2.  **This step only applicable if your content includes data that is not already public:** This is unlikely, unless you've sourced data yourself. The Information Security Officer (ISO) requires that you submit a Data Categorization Package (Data Cat). [Check the Data Cat instructions document here](https://cawaterboards.sharepoint.com/sites/RiskManagement/DataCategorizationLibrary/Forms/AllItems.aspx).

### Edit the User Manual

1.  Copy the GitHub repo with RStudio. (Anna can help you with this initial setup!)

2.  Before each work session, make sure to **pull any changes**. This ensures that the copied repository you have on your local device is up-to-date with changes that someone else may have made. 

3.  Locate and open the Layer Guide .qmd file. 

4.  Edit the user manual to reflect any changes that you've made to the map. To add a new layer, include:

    -   Layer name
    -   Succinct description
    -   Screenshot
    -   More information (only if necessary)
    -   Source
    -   Update frequency

5.  Save your local changes.

6.  Stage your local changes by checking them in the top right interface. 

7.  Commit them by pressing "Commit" and adding a commit message (brief description of changes).

8.  Push these changes to the main repo by pressing "Push."

## Closing

And that's it! Have a great fellowship.
